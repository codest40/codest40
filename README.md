- I’m Mark — a DevOps & Platform Engineer with strong Python backend roots, focused on building automated, secure, and reliable infrastructure.

- I design and build internal PaaS platforms, production-ready systems, and modern web applications end-to-end, backed by strong CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code, and observability from day one.

- My daily tools include Bash, Python, Docker, Git/GitHub Actions, Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes, and SRE tooling, and I spend most of my time going deep into platform engineering, DevSecOps, and infrastructure reliability at scale.

- I enjoy troubleshooting issues around automation, repeatability, and system ownership — turning fragile setups into stable platforms teams can trust.

- I’m open to collaborating on Backend, Platform, DevOps, Cloud, and open-source projects that value engineering depth and clean automation.
